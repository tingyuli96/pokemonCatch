#### help you find which pokemon will appear in a paticular location
Given an location with some features, you will find which pokemon will appear in this place

#### Interactive Data Visualize
Take pikachu as an example, you can see the city distribution in sortable bar chart

For all our data, you can see the distribution of cities, id and local time in hour. You can also choose one range in one of these three attributes and see the distribution of the other two attributes.
